# SBA 316: The Document Object Model

### Melvin Gonzalez, Jr. | 2024-35-RTT | Software Engineering

_In this project, I created a simple, one-page website. The website uses **HTML** and **CSS** for basic structure and styling. I used new knowledge in **JavaScript** to make the page more interactive._

_The page itself goes for the simple black-and-white theme with pops of color during events. I have events that occur when one hovers their mouse over the \<h2> elements with the text "Who am I?" and "My Why". Similar event occurs when one hovers over my picture, which goes from black-and-white to color. More events occur with the "Want to Connect?" form on the bottom left corner. On invalid inputs, the corresponding input box and label have new colors to bring attention. An alert box is used instead of default event messages because the alert box ensures the viewer reads the message as they must click "OK" to continue._

_This webpage is a rough draft of what I may do for a future personal project to have one website where others can learn about me, my professional life, projects I'm working on, and ways to interact with me. Just need more practice with CSS styling, as well as use other Front-end technologies._
